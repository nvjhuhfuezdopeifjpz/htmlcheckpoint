        <h2>What is One Piece's plot ?</h2>
        <p>
            The story of One Piece is set in a fictional world dominated by oceans , where some pirates yearn for an era of freedom and adventure known as the "Golden Age of Piracy" . This era was inaugurated following the last words spoken by the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, nicknamed Gold Roger before his execution 2 . Roger announces to the world that its inhabitants were free to seek all the riches he had accumulated during his entire life, the "  One Piece 3. " »
            <br>
    
            Twenty-two years after Roger's execution, interest in One Piece is waning. Many have given up on it, some even wonder if it really exists. Although pirates are still a threat to the locals, the Navy has become more effective in countering their attacks on all four seas: East Blue , North Blue , West Blue, and South Blue . However, this change did not deter Monkey D. Luffy , a young boy, from wanting to become the successor to the legendary Roger. He will thus set off on an adventure, giving himself the first objective of creating a crew in order to reach the Grand Line sea , where the fever of the“great wave of piracy” continues to rage, and where many big names in piracy are in pursuit of One Piece , believed to be on the last island in this great sea, Laugh Tale (spelling intended by Oda).
            <br>
            
            Luffy goes on an adventure after meeting Redhead Shanks, the captain of a pirate ship who spent a year in his village and saved him from a sea monster by sacrificing his left arm. Since then, Luffy wears his straw hat which he gave to him to mark the promise to become a great pirate. This hat will therefore become the symbol of his crew. It was during this time that he ate a devil fruit held by Shanks: the fruit of Gum Gum, and which made his body elastic. Devil fruits once eaten give special abilities to their holder, who at the same time loses all his strength when immersed in sea water, it is a curse. Luffy and his crew will meet many people who will strengthen their friendship and expand their crew.
